# Develop in other notebook environments

This guide addresses how to develop apps in Google Colab, VSCode, nteract, and other environments.

---

### Google Colab

In the Google Colaboratory notebook, first make sure to load the `pn.extension()`. Panel objects will then render themselves if they are the last item in a notebook cell. Please note that in Colab rendering for each notebook cell is isolated, which means that every cell must reload the Panel extension code separately. This will result in somewhat slower and larger notebook than with other notebook technologies.

* Be aware: using Panel with ipywidgets in Colab does not work, due to Colab's architecture constraints.

### Anaconda Cloud

When using Anaconda Cloud, make sure to upgrade the Panel package to the latest version using !pip install

### VSCode notebook

Visual Studio Code (VSCode) versions 2020.4.74986 and later support ipywidgets, and Panel objects can be used as ipywidgets since Panel 0.10 thanks to `jupyter_bokeh`, which means that you can now use Panel components interactively in VSCode. Ensure you install `jupyter_bokeh` with `pip install jupyter_bokeh` or `conda install -c bokeh jupyter_bokeh` and then enable the extension with `pn.extension()`.

See also the [How-To Configure VS Code Guide](../editor/vscode_configure.md).

### nteract and other ipywidgets notebooks

In other notebook environments that support rendering ipywidgets interactively, such as nteract, you can use the same underlying ipywidgets support as for vscode: Install ``jupyter_bokeh`` and then use ``pn.extension(comms='ipywidgets')``.

### Other environments

If your development environment offers embedded Python processes but does not support ipywidgets or Jupyter "comms" (communication channels), you will notice that some or all interactive functionality is missing. Some widgets that operate only in JavaScript will work fine, but others require communication channels between JavaScript and Python. In such cases you can either request ipywidgets or Panel support from the editor or environment, or else use the Editor + Server approach above.
