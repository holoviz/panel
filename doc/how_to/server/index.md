# Configuring a Panel server

The Panel server can be launched either from the commandline (using `panel serve`) or programmatically (using `panel.serve()`). In this guide we will discover how to run and configure server instances using these two options.

## The server

The Bokeh server is built on Tornado, which handles all of the communication between the browser and the backend. Whenever a user accesses the app or dashboard in a browser a new session is created which executes the app code and creates a new ``Document`` containing the models served to the browser where they are rendered by BokehJS.

If you do not want to maintain your own web server and/or set up complex reverse proxies various cloud providers make it relatively simple to quickly deploy arbitrary apps on their system. See the [deployment how-to guides](../deployment/index) for more details.
