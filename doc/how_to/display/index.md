# Display Components and Apps

One of the main design goals for Panel was that it should make it possible to seamlessly transition back and forth between interactively prototyping a dashboard in the notebook or on the commandline to deploying it as a standalone server app.

This guide will provide simple how-to guides on how to display panels interactively in a notebook or in your favorite editor environment.
