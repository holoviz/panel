# Accessing User information

## User State

Once a user is authorized with the chosen OAuth provider certain user information and an `access_token` will be available to be used in the session to customize the user experience. Like all other session state this may be accessed on the `pn.state` object, specifically it makes four attributes available:

* **`pn.state.user`**: A unique name, email or ID that identifies the user.
* **`pn.state.access_token`**: The access token issued by the OAuth provider to authorize requests to its APIs.
* **`pn.state.refresh_token`**: The refresh token issued by the OAuth provider to authorize requests to its APIs (if available these are usually longer lived than the `access_token`).
* **`pn.state.user_info`**: Additional user information provided by the OAuth provider. This may include names, email, APIs to request further user information, IDs and more.

Please note that the user information above is only available to the users session. Its not shared across sessions.
