# About

Panel is completely open source, available under a BSD license freely for both commercial and non-commercial use. Panel was originally developed at [Anaconda Inc.](https://anaconda.com) using funding from various commercial and government partners, and is now maintained by Anaconda developers along with community contributors.

Panel is part of the [HoloViz](https://holoviz.org) family of tools. The [holoviz.org](https://holoviz.org) website shows how to use Panel together with other libraries to solve complex problems, with detailed tutorials and examples. You can see a variety of projects using Panel at [examples.pyviz.org](https://examples.pyviz.org), and you can compare Panel to other available tools at [pyviz.org](https://pyviz.org) or on the [Explanation > Comparisons](../explanation/comparisons.md) page.

If you have any questions or usage issues visit the [Panel Discourse](https://discourse.holoviz.org/c/panel/) site. If you are interested in contributing to Panel development to help address some of the [open issues](https://github.com/holoviz/panel/issues), see our [developer instructions](https://holoviz-dev.github.io/panel/developer_guide/index.html) to set up your development environment.

If you like Panel and have built something you want to share, tweet a link or screenshot of your latest creation at @Panel_org, along with any other library you used (@HoloViews, @Datashader, @BokehPlots, @Matplotlib, etc.). Thanks!
