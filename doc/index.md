Panel is an [open-source](https://github.com/holoviz/panel/blob/main/LICENSE.txt) Python library that lets you **easily build powerful tools, dashboards and complex applications entirely in Python**. It has a batteries-included philosophy, putting the PyData ecosystem, powerful data tables and much more at your fingertips. High-level reactive APIs and lower-level callback based APIs ensure you can quickly build exploratory applications, but you aren't limited if you build complex, multi-page apps with rich interactivity. Panel is a member of the [HoloViz](https://holoviz.org/) ecosystem, your gateway into a connected ecosystem of data exploration tools.

```{notebook} panel ../examples/homepage.ipynb
:disable_interactivity_warning: True
```

Panel makes it simple to:

- Develop in your favorite **editor or notebook** environment
- Combine the **PyData tools and plotting libraries** that you know and love
- **Iterate quickly** to develop data tools, dashboards and complex apps
- **Collaborate** across skill levels and tool preferences
- Add **advanced bi-directional communication** to your data apps
- Create interactive **big data** applications with **crossfiltering**
- Create **high performing**, **streaming** data applications
- Create data apps that **can run entirely in the browser**
- Create **polished, performant, secure and production-ready web applications**
