# Display Performance with Indicators

Welcome to our tutorial on  Panel's [indicators](https://panel.holoviz.org/reference/index.html#indicators)!

We will delve into the use of Indicators with an example that uses them to visualizes the key metrics of wind turbines in an engaging and insightful manner. The result will be this:

## Explore Indicators

In this tutorial, we'll explore various indicators offered by Panel to showcase the performance metrics:

- **Current Performance**: Utilize the [`Number`](../../reference/indicators/Number.md) indicator to display the current performance.
- **Trending Performance**: Employ the [`Trend`](../../reference/indicators/Trend.md) indicator to showcase the trending performance over time.

For a comprehensive list of indicators and their detailed reference guides, you can always refer to the [Indicators Section](https://panel.holoviz.org/reference/index.html#indicators) in the [Component Gallery](../../reference/index.md).

:::{note}
Throughout this tutorial, whenever we refer to "run the code," you can execute it directly in the Panel docs using the green *run* button, in a notebook cell, or within a file named `app.py` served with `panel serve app.py --autoreload`.

## Display a Number

Let's start by displaying the wind speed using the `Number` indicator:

```{pyodide}
import panel as pn

pn.extension()

pn.indicators.Number(
    name="Wind Speed",
    value=8.6,
    format="{value} m/s",
    colors=[(10, "green"), (100, "red")],
).servable()
```

:::{note}
Adding `.servable()` to the `Number` indicator incorporates it into the app served by `panel serve app.py --autoreload`. Note that it's not necessary for displaying the indicator in a notebook.
:::

Feel free to tweak the `value` from `8.6` to `11.4` and observe the color change to *red*.

## Display a Trend

Next, let's visualize the hourly average wind speed trend:

```{pyodide}
import panel as pn
import numpy as np

pn.extension()

def get_wind_speeds(n):
    # Replace this with your own wind speed data source
    return {"x": np.arange(n), "y": 8 + np.random.randn(n)}

pn.indicators.Trend(
    name="Wind Speed (m/s, hourly avg.)",
    data=get_wind_speeds(24),
    width=500,
    height=300,
).servable()
```

Experiment by adjusting the `height` parameter from `300` to `500`.

For more detailed insights into the `Trend` indicator, take a moment to explore its [reference guide](../../reference/indicators/Trend.md). Trust us, it's worth it!

## Recap

In this tutorial, we have explored using Panel's versatile indicators by creating a visualization of the performance metrics of wind turbines. We:

- Leveraged the [`Number`](../../reference/indicators/Number.md) indicator to display current performance.
- Utilized the [`Trend`](../../reference/indicators/Trend.md) indicator to showcase trending performance over time.

Remember, there's a collection of indicators waiting for you to explore in the [Indicators Section](https://panel.holoviz.org/reference/index.html#indicators) of the [Component Gallery](../../reference/index.md). Keep experimenting and uncovering new insights! ðŸš€
