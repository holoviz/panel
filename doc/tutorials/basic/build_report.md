# Build a Report

In this section, we will collaboratively create a *Wind Turbine Report*. Together, we will:

- Layout and style the report nicely.
- Export the report to a static `.html` file using the `.save` method.
- Distribute the report via email.

# Extract Data

TEXT ="""# Wind Turbine

A wind turbine is a device that converts the kinetic energy of wind into \
[electrical energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_energy).

The most visible part of a wind turbine is its *rotor*, which typically consists of two or three long *blades* attached to a central hub. These blades are meticulously designed to efficiently capture the energy of the wind as it passes through them. Through careful aerodynamic engineering, the shape, length, and angle of the blades are optimized to maximize the amount of kinetic energy they can extract from the wind.

As the wind blows, it causes the rotor blades to rotate. This rotational motion is transferred to a generator housed within the turbine's nacelle, a large enclosure situated atop a tall tower. The generator converts the mechanical energy of the rotating blades into electrical energy through the principles of electromagnetic induction. This electricity is then transmitted via cables down the tower and into the electrical grid for distribution to homes, businesses, and industries.

The height of the tower plays a crucial role in the efficiency of a wind turbine. By elevating the rotor assembly high above the ground, turbines can access stronger and more consistent wind speeds, which translates to higher energy production. Taller towers also help minimize the impact of surface friction and turbulence near the ground, allowing the rotor blades to operate more smoothly and efficiently.

## Explanation

Let's break down and explain the code:

```{pyodide}
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
import panel as pn
```

Here, we import the necessary libraries: [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) for data visualization, [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data manipulation, and [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org) for creating interactive web apps.

```{pyodide}
pn.extension("vega", sizing_mode="stretch_width")
```

Additionally we load the `"vega"` renderer, which enables rendering Altair plots, and set the sizing mode to `"stretch_width"` to make sure the content fills the available horizontal space.

@pn.cache
def get_data():
    return pd.read_csv("https://assets.holoviz.org/panel/tutorials/turbines.csv.gz")

df = get_data()
```

We define a multiline string `TEXT` containing some markdown text describing wind turbines. Then, we define a function `get_data()` decorated with `@pn.cache` to cache the data retrieval operation. This function reads a CSV file containing turbine data from a URL and returns a Pandas DataFrame, which we store in the variable `df`.

```{pyodide}
count = len(df)
total_capacity = df.t_cap.sum()
avg_capacity = df.t_cap.mean() / 10**3
avg_rotor_diameter = df.t_rd.mean()
top_manufacturers = (
    df.groupby("t_manu").p_cap.sum().sort_values().iloc[-10:].index.to_list()
)
example_df = df.dropna().sample(5).iloc[:5,:13].reset_index(drop=True)
```

We calculate various summary statistics from the dataset, such as the total count of turbines, the total capacity, the average capacity (converted to MW), the average rotor diameter, and a list of top manufacturers by total capacity. Additionally, we create an example DataFrame (`example_df`) containing a random sample of turbine data to display in a table later.

```{pyodide}
df = df[df.t_manu.isin(top_manufacturers)]
fig = (
    alt.Chart(
        df.sample(5000),
        title="Capacity by Manufacturer",
    )
    .mark_circle(size=8)
    .encode(
        y="t_manu:N",
        x="p_cap:Q",
        yOffset="jitter:Q",
        color=alt.Color("t_manu:N").legend(None),
        tooltip=["t_manu", "p_cap"],
    )
    .transform_calculate(jitter="sqrt(-2*log(random()))*cos(2*PI*random())")
    .properties(
        height=400,
        width="container",
    )
)
```

We filter the dataset to include only the turbines from the top manufacturers. Then, we create an Altair scatter plot (`fig`) to visualize the capacity of turbines by manufacturer. We encode the manufacturer on the y-axis, the capacity on the x-axis, and use jitter to prevent overplotting. The tooltip shows the manufacturer and capacity when hovering over data points.

```{pyodide}
BRAND_COLOR = "teal"
BRAND_TEXT_ON_COLOR = "white"

CARD_STYLE = {
  "box-shadow": "rgba(50, 50, 93, 0.25) 0px 6px 12px -2px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3) 0px 3px 7px -3px",
  "padding": "10px",
  "border-radius": "5px"
}

header = pn.Row(
    pn.pane.Markdown(
        "# Wind Turbine Report", styles={"color": BRAND_TEXT_ON_COLOR}, margin=(5, 20)
    ),
    styles={"background": BRAND_COLOR},
)
```

Here, we define some styling constants and create a header for the report, which consists of a Markdown title styled with the brand color and a teal background.

```{pyodide}
indicators = pn.FlexBox(
    pn.indicators.Number(
        value=total_capacity / 1e6,
        name="Total Capacity (GW)",
        format="{value:,.0f}",
        styles=CARD_STYLE,
    ),
    pn.indicators.Number(
        value=avg_capacity,
        name="Avg. Capacity (MW)",
        format="{value:,.1f}",
        styles=CARD_STYLE,
    ),
    pn.indicators.Number(
        value=avg_rotor_diameter,
        name="Avg. Rotor Diameter (m)",
        format="{value:,.0f}",
        styles=CARD_STYLE,
    ),
    pn.indicators.Number(
        value=avg_rotor_diameter,
        name="Avg. Rotor Diameter (m)",
        format="{value:,.0f}",
        styles=CARD_STYLE,
    ),
    pn.indicators.Number(
        value=count,
        name="Count",
        format="{value:,.0f}",
        styles=CARD_STYLE,
    ),
    margin=(20, 5),
)

plot = pn.pane.Vega(
    fig,
    styles=CARD_STYLE,
    margin=10,
)
table = pn.pane.DataFrame(example_df, styles=CARD_STYLE)
```

We create various components for the report, including a set of indicators (total capacity, average capacity, etc.), a Vega plot (`plot`) displaying the capacity by manufacturer, and a DataFrame (`table`) showing example turbine data.

```{pyodide}
main = pn.Column(
    "# Summary",
    indicators,
    TEXT,
    "## Manufacturer Capacities",
    plot,
    "## Turbine Examples",
    table,
)
```

We assemble the main content of the report (`main`) as a Column layout, including the summary section, the indicators, the Markdown text, the plot, and the table.

```{pyodide}
main_container = pn.Row(
    main,
    max_width=1024,
    styles={"margin-right": "auto", "margin-left": "auto", "margin-top": "10px", "margin-bottom": "20px"},
)
report = pn.Column(header, main_container)
report
```

We create a container (`main_container`) to hold the main content with a maximum width and some margin styling. Then, we compose the entire report (`report`) by combining the header and the main container.

```python
report.save("report.html")
```

Finally, we save the report as an HTML file named "report.html". This HTML file will contain the rendered content of the report, including the header, indicators, text, plot, and table.

:::{note}
With `.save` you can produce *static* reports that display content and have very limited interactivity. It is possible to add more interactivity. Check out the [*Embed State*](../../how_to/export/embedding.md) or [Convert Panel Applications](../../how_to/wasm/convert.md) guides for more detail.
