# Basic Tutorials

Welcome to the Basic Tutorials!

Are you ready to dive into the exciting world of Panel? Our Basic Tutorials are designed to guide you step by step through building awesome apps with wind turbine data. Whether you're a beginner or an enthusiast, we've got you covered! And don't hesitate to reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/rb6gPXbdAr) if you need help along the way.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive in, make sure you've followed along with our [Getting Started Guide](../../getting_started/index.md).

Please execute the following command to install the dependencies required by the basic tutorials:

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} pip
:sync: pip

```bash
pip install altair hvplot matplotlib numpy pandas panel plotly scipy watchfiles
```

:::

:::{tab-item} conda
:sync: conda

```bash
conda install -y -c conda-forge altair hvplot matplotlib numpy pandas panel plotly scipy watchfiles
```

:::

:::{important}
Is Panel installed together with JupyterLab/Jupyter Notebook in your working environment? If not, you need to make sure that `panel` is also installed in the same environment as JupyterLab/Jupyter Notebook (`pip install panel` or `conda install panel`).

## Let's Get Started

Start your journey with these foundational tutorials:

- **[Build Hello World App](serve.md):** Kick things off with a simple app.
- **[Develop in Notebooks](develop_notebook.md):** Learn how to build apps right in your notebooks.
- **[Develop in Editors](develop_editor.md):** Explore tips for developing in your favorite code editor.

## Master Panel Basics

Once you're comfortable, it's time to dive deeper. Through a series of lessons we will learn about displaying content, arranging it on the page, handling user inputs and then how to improve the UI and UX of our applications.

### 1. Display Content

- **[`pn.panel`](pn_panel.md):** Learn to display Python objects easily with `pn.panel`
- **[Panes](panes.md):** Learn to display content by creating Panes.
- **[Indicators](indicators_performance.md):** Visualize key metrics with simple indicators

### 2. Organize Content

- **[Layouts](layouts.md):** Arrange output on the page using layouts.
- **[Control the Size](size.md):** Learn to control the sizing of your components.
- **[Align Content](align.md):** Discover how to align content on the page.

### 3. Handle User Input

- **[Widgets](widgets.md):** Learn about handling user input with widgets.
- **[React to User Input](pn_bind.md):** Learn about reacting to user input by binding it to interactive components.
- **[Reactive Expressions](pn_rx.md):** Learn about handling state and writing entire reactive expressions.

### 4. Improve the Look

- **[Templates](templates.md):** Learn to structure your app with pre-built templates.
- **[Designs](design.md):** Style your apps using pre-built *designs*
- **[Styles](style.md):** Further customize the look and feel by adding CSS styling.

### 5. Improve the Feel

- **[Caching](caching.md):** Leverage caching to enhance the speed and efficiency of your app.
- **[Activity Indicators](indicators_activity.md):** Indicate progress and add notifications to improve the user experience.
- **[Progressive Updates](progressive_layouts.md):** Efficiently and effortlessly update the content in your app with progressive updates.

## Share Your Creations

Share your awesome apps with the world!

- **[Build a Dashboard](build_dashboard.md)**
- **[Deploy a Dashboard](deploy.md)**

## Ready for Projects?

Now that you've got the basics down, it's time to put your skills to the test:

- **[Build a Report](build_report.md)**
- **[Build an Animation](build_animation.md)**
- **[Build an Image Classifier](build_image_classifier.md)**
- **[Build a Monitoring Dashboard](build_monitoring_dashboard.md)**
- **[Build a Crossfiltering Dashboard](build_crossfilter_dashboard.md)**
- **[Build a Streaming Dashboard](build_streaming_dashboard.md)**
- **[Build a Chat Bot](build_chatbot.md)**
- **[Build a Todo App](build_todo.md)**
