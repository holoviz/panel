# Develop in an Editor

Welcome to the "Develop in an Editor" section! Here, we'll explore how to develop Panel apps efficiently right within your favorite editor.

Let's dive in!

## Serve Your App with Autoreload

Let's serve our app with autoreload. Autoreload ensures that your app updates in real-time as you make changes, providing a smooth development experience.

### Serving Your App

Imagine you have a simple Panel app like the following:

```python
import panel as pn
import numpy as np

from matplotlib.figure import Figure

ACCENT = "goldenrod"
LOGO = "https://assets.holoviz.org/panel/tutorials/matplotlib-logo.png"

pn.extension(sizing_mode="stretch_width")

data = np.random.normal(1, 1, size=100)
fig = Figure(figsize=(8, 4))
ax = fig.subplots()
ax.hist(data, bins=20, color=ACCENT)

component = pn.pane.Matplotlib(fig, format='svg', sizing_mode='scale_both')

pn.template.FastListTemplate(
    title="My App", sidebar=[LOGO], main=[component], accent=ACCENT
).servable()
```

Copy this code into a file named `app.py` and save it.

Now, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
panel serve app.py --dev
```

This will start the server and provide you with a URL where your app is being served. Open this URL in your browser to see your app in action.

It should look like

![Panel served app](../../_static/images/develop_editor_panel_serve_before.png)

Now change the

- `ACCENT` value to `teal` and save the `app.py` file.
- `bins` value to `15` and save.
- `title` value to `"My Matplotlib App"` and save.

It should look like

    <source src="https://assets.holoviz.org/panel/tutorials/develop_editor_serve_app.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.

## Inspect via Hover

One of the benefits of developing in an editor is the ability to inspect Panel objects conveniently via hover. Simply hover over the object you want to inspect, and you'll see tooltips providing useful information and links to reference guides.

Let's say you want to inspect the `FastListTemplate` object in your code. Hover over it, and you'll see a tooltip with an example code snippet and a reference link. Clicking the reference link takes you directly to the reference guide for further information.

## Inspect via `print`

Another handy way to inspect objects is by printing them. This allows you to see detailed information about the object's structure and contents.

Consider the following code snippet:

```python
import panel as pn

pn.extension(design="material")

component = pn.panel("Hello World")
layout = pn.Column(
    component, pn.widgets.IntSlider(value=2, start=0, end=10, name="Value")
)
print(layout)
layout.servable()
```

Serving this code will print information about the `layout` object, revealing its structure and attributes.

Serve the app by running the below command in a terminal.

```bash
panel serve app.py --dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5006/app](http://localhost:5006/app) in a browser.

This will look something like the below in the terminal.

```bash

2024-02-22 20:39:50,406 User authentication hooks NOT provided (default user enabled)
2024-02-22 20:39:50,413 Bokeh app running at: http://localhost:5006/app

2024-02-22 20:39:52,712 WebSocket connection opened
2024-02-22 20:39:52,713 ServerConnection created
```

## Inspect Parameters via `.param`

You can inspect the parameters of Panel components using the `.param` namespace and its `_repr_html_` method.

Copy the code below into a file `app.py`:

```python
import panel as pn

pn.extension(design="material")

component = pn.panel("Hello World")

pn.Row(
    component.param, pn.pane.HTML(component.param._repr_html_())
).servable()
```

Serve the app with `panel serve app.py --dev`.

Open [http://localhost:5006](http://localhost:5006) in a browser.

It should look like

![.param and .param._repr_html_()](../../_static/images/develop_editor_param.png)
