# Develop in an Editor

In this section you will learn more advances techniques to develop efficiently in an editor:

- Resetting the cache with `pn.state.clear_caches()` or `some_cached_func.clear()`.
- Debug with [Pdb](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html) by inserting a `breakpoint()`

Some of the features demonstrated in this guide might require special configuration of your editor. For configuration we refer you to the [Resources](#resources) section below and general resources on the web.

## Resetting the Cache

When developing with the `--dev` option and utilizing caching, you may need to reset the cache. You have the option to clear either the entire cache or just the cache for a specific function.

Execute the code below:

```python
import panel as pn
from datetime import datetime

pn.extension()

# To clear the entire cache, uncomment the following line:
# pn.state.clear_caches()

@pn.cache
def get_data():
    return datetime.now()

# To clear the cache for this specific function, uncomment:
# get_data.clear()

pn.panel(get_data).servable()
```

To reset the cache, uncomment and use either `pn.state.clear_caches()` for the entire cache or `get_data.clear()` for the specific function's cache. Below is a video demonstrating this process:

## Debug your App with Pdb

A simple way to debug your apps that works in any editor is to insert a `breakpoint()`.

Copy the code below into a file named `app.py`.

```python
import panel as pn

pn.extension(design="material")

def handle_click(event):
    breakpoint()

pn.widgets.Button(name="Click Me", on_click=handle_click, button_type="primary").servable()
```

Serve the app with `panel serve app.py --dev`.

Open [http://localhost:5006/app](http://localhost:5006/app) in a browser.

The app will look something like

![App with `Click Me` button](../../_static/images/develop_editor_click_me.png)

Click the `Click Me` Button.

Your terminal will look something like

```bash
$ panel serve app.py --dev
2024-01-20 08:12:09,512 Starting Bokeh server version 3.3.3 (running on Tornado 6.4)
2024-01-20 08:12:09,514 User authentication hooks NOT provided (default user enabled)
2024-01-20 08:12:09,516 Bokeh app running at: http://localhost:5006/app
2024-01-20 08:12:09,516 Starting Bokeh server with process id: 9768
2024-01-20 08:12:10,608 WebSocket connection opened
2024-01-20 08:12:10,608 ServerConnection created
--Return--
> /home/jovyan/app.py(6)handle_click()->None
-> breakpoint()
(Pdb)
```

Write `event` in the terminal. Press `ENTER`.

It should look like

![Breakpoint](../../_static/images/develop_editor_breakpoint.png)

Write `help` and press `ENTER` for more info. It will look like

```bash
(Pdb) help
