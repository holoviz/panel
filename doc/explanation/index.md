# Explanation

The explanation section aims to clarify, deepen, and broaden the understanding of Panel with discussions about topics at a high-level or from alternate angles. This may include reasoning about design decisions, historical development, and technical constraints.

Beyond the [Getting Started > Core Concepts](../getting_started/core_concepts.md), which new users must complete before working with Panel, this explanation section is intended to help practitioners form and strengthen a conceptual web that facilitates new and advanced usage directions.

## APIs

In this section we will discuss the principles and design decisions behind Panel's APIs in order to guide you towards the best approach for structuring your applications. We begin with a set of explanations behind the use of Param in Panel, how it unlocks reactive approaches to write applications and contrast function and class based approaches for writing apps.

Next let us contrast the different APIs offered by Panel by applying them to a particular problem.

:link: api/callbacks
:link-type: doc

Generate a UI by manually declaring callbacks that update panels or panes.
:::

::::

Finally let's look at some examples demonstrating how each API can be applied to build the same app:
