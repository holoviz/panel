# Functions vs. Classes

## Development Flow

As you gear up to develop your Panel application, you'll encounter a couple of initial decisions to make regarding **approach** and **environment**:

1. **Programming Approach:** Will you opt for a Python *function-based* approach or a *class-based* approach?
   - The function-based approach is recommended for new and basic users. It utilizes `pn.bind`, as you've already experienced while [building a simple app](build_app.md).
   - The class-based approach is recommended for intermediate Panel users who aim to construct larger and more maintainable apps, as well as reusable components.

   Interested in a class-based approach instead?

   Explore the same ['outlier' app built using a class-based declarative API](../explanation/api/examples/outliers_declarative.md). Study the [Explanation > APIs](../explanation/api/index.md) section for a detailed discussion on each of the API options.

2. **Development Environment:** Will you develop in a notebook or in an editor environment?
   - If you're unsure, starting in a notebook is recommended as you familiarize yourself with Panel. However, you can switch between them at any time.

Please refer to the [Getting Started > Core Concepts](../getting_started/core_concepts.md) for more info.

This [Best practices document](../getting_started/core_concepts.md) contains some examples of do's and don'ts that involve classes.
