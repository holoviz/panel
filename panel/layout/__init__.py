Layout
======

Layouts can layout your python objects and panel components.

Most layouts behave as the Python containers you already know. For example
`Column` and `Row` behaves as lists. I.e. they have a list-like API with
methods to `append`, `extend`, `clear`, `insert`, `pop`, `remove` and
`__setitem__`, which make it possible to interactively update and modify them.

Check out the Panel gallery of layouts

How to use layouts in 2 simple steps
------------------------------------

1. Define your Python objects

>>> some_python_object = ...
>>> some_widget = pn.widgets...
>>> some_pane = pn.pane...

2. Define your layouts

>>> pn.Column(some_python_object, some_widget, some_pane)
