The bokeh server makes it possible to share the app or dashboard you have built locally, your own web server or using any of the numerous cloud providers. In this guide we will go through the details of deploying an app on a local system or cloud provider step by step."

This is a good option for simple deployments on a local network.\n",

    "\n",
    "Run the server as usual on the remote host:\n",

You may be prompted for login credentials for the remote system. After the connection is set up you will be able to navigate to localhost:5006 as though the Bokeh server were running on the local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second, slightly more complicated case occurs when there is a gateway between the server and the local machine. In that situation a reverse tunnel must be established from the server to the gateway. Additionally the tunnel from the local machine will also point to the gateway.\n",

    "1. Create a new Git repo (or to follow along clone the [minimal-heroku-demo](https://github.com/pyviz-demos/minimal-heroku-demo) GitHub repo)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add a Jupyter notebook or Python script which declares a Panel app or dashboard to the repository.\n",

    "panel\n",
    "hvplot\n",
    "scikit-learn\n",
    "```\n",

    "3. Define a `Procfile` which declares the command Heroku should run to serve the app. In the sample app the following command serves the `iris_kmeans.ipynb` example. The websocket origin should match the name of the app on Heroku ``app-name.herokuapp.com`` which you will declare in the next step:\n",
