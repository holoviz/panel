While we have already seen how to declare a ``Parameterized`` class with parameters which are linked to some visualization or computation on a method using the ``param.depends`` decorator, ``Pipelines`` make use of another decorator and a convention for displaying the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``param.output`` decorator provides a way to annotate the methods on a class by declaring its outputs. A ``Pipeline`` uses this information to determine what outputs are available to be fed into the next stage of the workflow. In the example below the ``Stage1`` class has two parameters of its own (``a`` and ``b``) and one output, which is named ``c``. The signature of the decorator allows a number of different ways of declaring the outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ``param.output()``: Declaring an output without arguments will declare that the method returns an output which will inherit the name of the method and does not make any specific type declarations.\n",
    "* ``param.output(param.Number)``: Declaring an output with a specific ``Parameter`` or Python type also declares an output with the name of the method but declares that the output will be of a specific type.\n",
    "* ``param.output(c=param.Number)``: Declaring an output using a keyword argument allows overriding the method name as the name of the output and declares the type.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to declare multiple parameters, either as keywords (Python >= 3.6 required) or tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ``param.output(c=param.Number, d=param.String)`` or ``param.output(('c', param.Number), ('d', param.String))``\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below the output is simply the result of multiplying the two inputs (``a`` and ``b``) which will produce output ``c``. Additionally we declare a ``view`` method which returns a ``LaTeX`` pane which will render the equation to ``LaTeX``. Finally a ``panel`` method declares returns a Panel object rendering both the parameters and the view; this is the second convention that a ``Pipeline`` expects.\n",
