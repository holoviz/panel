    "One of the main goals when designing ``Panel`` was that it should make it possible to seamlessly transition from interactively prototyping a dashboard in the notebook or on the commandline to deploying it as a standalone server app. This section will discover how to display panels interactively, embed static output, saving a snapshot and deploying it as a standalone app.\n",

    "\n",
    "As you may have noticed almost all the ``Panel`` documentation is written using notebooks, ``Panel`` objects display themselves in the notebook and take advantage of Jupyter Comms to support communication between the rendered app and the Jupyter kernel backing it on the Python end. To display a panel object in the notebook is as simple as putting it on the end of a cell. Note however that the ``panel.extension`` has to be loaded to initialize the required Javascript and if you are working in JupyterLab the pyviz labextension has to be installed with:\n",
    "\n",
    "    jupyter labextension install @pyviz/jupyterlab_pyviz\n",

    "\n",
    "    pn.extension('vega', 'katex')\n",
    "    \n",
    "will ensure that the Vega and LaTeX JS dependencies are loaded. Additionally any external ``css_files``, ``js_files`` and ``raw_css`` should be declared in the extension. The ``js_files`` should be declared as a dictionary mapping from the exported JS module name to the URL containing the JS components, while the ``css_files`` can be defined as a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "    pn.extension(js_files={'deck': https://unpkg.com/deck.gl@~5.2.0/deckgl.min.js},\n",

    "\n",
    "Meanwhile ``raw_css`` can be defined as a list of CSS strings. Providing keyword arguments via the ``extension`` is the same as setting them on ``pn.config``, which is the preferred approach outside the notebook, e.g. ``js_files`` and ``css_files`` may be set as follows:\n",
