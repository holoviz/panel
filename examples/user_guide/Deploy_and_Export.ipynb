    "One of the main design goals for Panel was that it should make it possible to seamlessly transition back and forth between interactively prototyping a dashboard in the notebook or on the commandline to deploying it as a standalone server app. This section shows how to display panels interactively, embed static output, save a snapshot, and deploy as a separate web-server app.\n",

    "As you may have noticed, almost all the Panel documentation is written using notebooks. Panel objects display themselves automatically in a notebook and take advantage of Jupyter Comms to support communication between the rendered app and the Jupyter kernel that backs it on the Python end. To display a Panel object in the notebook is as simple as putting it on the end of a cell. Note, however, that the ``panel.extension`` first has to be loaded to initialize the required JavaScript in the notebook context.  Also, if you are working in JupyterLab, the pyviz labextension has to be installed with:\n",
