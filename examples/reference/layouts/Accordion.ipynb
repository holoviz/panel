    "``Accordion`` layouts are a type of ``Card`` layout that allows switching between multiple objects by clicking on the corresponding card header. The labels for each card may be defined explicitly as part of a tuple, and otherwise default to the ``name`` parameter of the card's contents. Like ``Column`` and ``Row``, ``Tabs`` has a list-like API that allows interactively updating and modifying the cards using methods ``append``, ``extend``, ``clear``, ``insert``, ``pop``, ``remove`` and ``__setitem__`` (to replace the contents).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **``active``** (list, default=[]): The indexes of the currently displayed cards. Updates when a card is expanded or collapsed and may also be set to programmatically control which cards are shown.\n",
    "* **``objects``** (list): The list of objects to display in the Column. Should not generally be modified directly except when replaced in its entirety.\n",
    "* **``toggle``** (bool): Whether to toggle between the available cards, activating only one at a time (if True), or (if False) whether to allow multiple cards to be expanded simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Styling-related parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **``active_header_background``** (str): The background color of the header when the `Card` is expanded.\n",
    "* **``header_color``** (str): The color of the header text.\n",
    "* **``header_background``** (str): The background color of the header.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further layout and styling-related parameters see the [Control the size](../../tutorials/basic/size.md), [Align Content](../../tutorials/basic/align.md) and [Style](../../tutorials/basic/style.md) tutorials.\n",

If the objects are not already Panel components they will each be converted to one using the ``pn.panel`` conversion method. Unlike other panel types, ``Accordion`` also accepts tuples to specify the title of each tab; if no name is supplied explicitly the name of the underlying object will be used."

Instead, use the provided methods for adding and removing items from the list.  The only change that is safe to make directly to ``Accordion.objects`` is to replace the list of ``objects`` entirely.  As a simple example of using the methods, we might add an additional widget to the ``Accordion`` using the `append` method:"
