    "The ``VTK`` pane renders a VTK scene inside a panel, making it possible to interact with complex geometries in 3D.\n",

    "Here Python acts as a server, sending information about the scene to the client.\n",
    "The synchronization is done in only one direction: Python => JavaScript. Modifications done on the JavaScript side are not reflected back to the Python ``vtkRenderWindow``.\n",

    "#### Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "For layout and styling related parameters see the [customization user guide](../../user_guide/Customization.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **``axes``** (dict): A dictionary with the parameters of the axes to construct in the 3d view.\n",
    "    Must contain at least ``xticker``, ``yticker`` and ``zticker``.\n",
    "    - ``[x|y|z]ticker`` is a dictionary which contains:\n",
    "        - ``ticks`` (array of numbers) - required. Positions in the scene coordinates\n",
    "        of the coresponding axe ticks\n",
    "        - ``labels`` (array of strings) - optional. Label displayed respectively to\n",

    "\n",
    "        If `labels` are not defined they are infered from the `ticks` array.\n",
    "    - ``digits``: number of decimal digits when `ticks` are converted to `labels`.\n",
    "    - ``fontsize``: size in pts of the ticks labels.\n",
    "    - ``show_grid``: boolean. If true (default) the axes grid is visible.\n",
    "    - ``grid_opacity``: float between 0-1. Defines the grid opacity.\n",
    "    - ``axes_opacity``: float between 0-1. Defines the axes lines opacity.\n",
    "* **``camera``** (dict): A dictionary reflecting the current state of the VTK camera\n",
    "* **``enable_keybindings``** (bool): A boolean to activate/deactivate keybindings. Bound keys are:\n",
    "  - s: set representation of all actors to *surface*\n",
    "  - w: set representation of all actors to *wireframe*\n",
    "  - v: set representation of all actors to *vertex*\n",

    "  \n",
    "  The mouse must be over the pane to work\n",
    "  <br>**Warning**: These keybindings may not work as expected in a notebook context, if they interact with already bound keys\n",
    "* **``orientation_widget``** (bool): A boolean to activate/deactivate the orientation widget in the 3D pane.\n",
    "* **``ìnteractive_orientation_widget``** (bool): If True the orientation widget is clickable and allows to rotate the scene in one of the orthographic projections.\n",
    "  <br>**Warning**: if set to True, synchronization capabilities of `VTKRenderWindowSynchronized` panes could not work.\n",

    "#### Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Several helpers to work with the VTK scene are exposed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **``set_background(r: float, g: float, b: float)``** : Set the color of the scene background as an RGB color, where `r`, `g`, and `b` are floats in the range (0, 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **``synchronize()``** : Synchronize the Python-side ``vtkRenderWindow`` object state with JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "* **``unlink_camera()``** : Create a new vtkCamera object, allowing the panel to have its own camera.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **``link_camera(other: VTK)``** : Set both panels to share the same camera; any change in either panel's camera will be applied to the other\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning** after using any of these methods to modify the state of vtkRenderWindow, the `sychronize()` method must be called for those changes to affect the display\n",
