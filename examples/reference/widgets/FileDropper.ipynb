    "The `FileDropper` allows the user to upload one or more files to the server. It is built on top of the [FilePond](https://pqina.nl/filepond/) library, if you use this component extensively consider donating to them. The `FileDropper` is similar to the `FileInput` widget but additionally adds support for chunked uploads, making it possible to upload large files. The UI also supports previews for image files. Unlike `FileInput` the uploaded files are stored as dictionary of bytes object indexed by the filename.\n",
