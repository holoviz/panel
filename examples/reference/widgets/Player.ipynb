    "The ``Player`` widget displays media-player-like controls that allow playing and stepping through a range of values. When playing it triggers events at a pre-defined interval on the frontend, advancing the player value each time. It falls into the broad category of single-value slider widgets that provide a compatible API and includes the [``IntSlider``](IntSlider.ipynb) and [``FloatSlider``](FloatSlider.ipynb) widgets.\n",

To express interactivity entirely using Javascript without the need for a Python server take a look at the [links user guide](../../user_guide/Param.ipynb).\n",
